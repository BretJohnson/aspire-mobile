# .NET MAUI + Aspire

***.NET MAUI support for Aspire***

[![NuGet package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MauiAspire.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/MauiAspire)

This project provides the integration code necessary to use .NET MAUI with Aspire. It also includes a .NET MAUI + Aspire project template. It's currently experimental, and we want
your feedback.


## Creating a new MAUI+Aspire project

Current status (to set expectations): The NuGets aren't published quite yet and we're still fixing some things.

dotnet new install MauiAspire.ProjectTemplates
```

In Visual Studio: `File` / `New Project` / `.NET MAUI App with Aspire` / `MyApp`

or create a project from the CLI:
